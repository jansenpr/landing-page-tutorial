HEADLINE REQUIREMENTS:
Combine three critical elements in each headline:
1. Emotional Dream Outcome: The identity shift or ultimate relief (e.g., Freedom, Status, Control).

'SITE GENERATION PROMPT: 

1. **Setup**: Create a new Project in the Stitch MCP titled "[Product Name] Landing Page".
2. **Generation**: Using the @stitch MCP and the new Project ID, generate a complete, high-fidelity landing page screen based on the structured content and design specifications in this file, following these instructions:
   a. **File Management**: Save all resulting files (index.html, CSS, boilerplate pages) into the `output` folder.
   b. **Design System**: Strictly adhere to the "DESIGN SYSTEM (REQUIRED)" section at the end of the file.
   c. **Content Integration**:
      - **Hero Section**: Use the selected Headline and Sub-headline.
      - **Problem Section**: Implement the PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solve) copy.
      - **Value Props**: Display the core features and benefit-driven headlines.
      - **Social Proof**: Include the generated testimonials.
      - **CTA**: Place the Call to Action and signup form as specified. Note: use the google form embed code for the form. **CRITICAL**: All Call to Action buttons must be implemented as anchor links (e.g., `#form-section`) that scroll the user down to the signup form section.
   d. **Technical Requirements**:
      - **Responsiveness**: The site MUST be fully responsive and look stunning on both Desktop and Mobile devices. Use a container-based layout that breathes on large screens but remains functional on small ones.
      - Use semantic HTML and modern CSS.
      - minimise dependencies on external libraries.
      - optimize for fast loading and accessibility.
      - the site should be static HTML/CSS/JS suitable for deployment as a static site to Firebase Hosting.
   e. Add boilerplate pages for about us, privacy policy and terms of service in the `output` folder and link to them from the landing page footer.
   f. If a Gemini chatbot is added do not make it require a login. It should be available to all visitors. It should not require microphone nor camera permissions.
   g. Add a favicon to the site. Create a favicon.ico in the `output` folder as the favicon.

Execute the site generation using the Stitch MCP, save the files to the `output` directory, and provide the preview link or file path.

- if the cli does not have node and npm installed and available, install it using the instructions here https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- if the cli does not have firebase-tools installed and available, install it using `npm install -g firebase-tools`.
- check if the cli is logged in to Firebase by running `firebase login --no-localhost`. If not logged in, this will provide a URL and a code. Show these to the user and ask them to authenticate in their browser and paste the verification code back to you.


1.  **Project Creation**: 
    - Ask the user to go to [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com) and create a new project named "[Product Name]".
    - Ask them to Enable Google Analytics for the project when prompted.

3.  **Initialization**:
    - Once logged in and provided with the Project ID, do NOT run `firebase init`.
    - Instead, directly create the configuration files **inside the `output` folder**:
      - Create `output/firebase.json` with hosting configuration: `{"hosting": {"public": "."}}`.
      - Create `output/.firebaserc` with content: `{"projects": {"default": "USER_PROVIDED_PROJECT_ID"}}`.
