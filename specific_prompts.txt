Sub-headline: Our verification-first mechanism finds local, healthy, purebred dachshunds for your pup in under 48 hours. Launch your legacy today.

**THE PROBLEM SECTION**
Dear Dachshund Owner,

* Are you tired of scrolling through unverified Facebook groups only to find "mates" with zero health history?
* Do you feel like you're gambling with your Doxie's legacy every time you explore local word-of-mouth leads?
* Are you frustrated by how difficult it is to find a truly compatible, purebred breeding partner nearby?

You love your dachshund. They aren't just a pet; they are a member of your family and a bearer of a prestigious pedigree. You want to continue that line responsibly, but the "Old Way" is making it nearly impossible.

Currently, you're stuck relying on unreliable social media groups or waiting weeks for a "friend of a friend" to call you back. Every day you wait is a missed opportunity, and every unverified lead is a massive risk to the health and future of your litter. Nothing feels secure, and the stress of finding a "good enough" match is keeping you from the joy of the process.

There is a better way.

Introducing Doxie Dates—the "New Opportunity" for responsible breeders. We’ve replaced the chaos of the internet with a sleek, verification-first matching app. No more guessing games. No more unreliable groups. Just a direct bridge to the healthy, purebred match your dachshund deserves.

**VALUE PROPOSITIONS**
1. Verified Pedigrees: Eliminate the guesswork and secure your dachshund’s prestigious legacy with 100% verified purebred pedigree matches.
2. Proximity Matching: Stop traveling for miles and find the perfect, healthy breeding partner right in your local neighborhood.
3. Health Screening: Protect your future litter with confidence by connecting only with mates that have documented health clearances.
4. Dating App UI: Experience the freedom of modern matching with a sleek, easy-to-use interface designed specifically for dachshund owners.

“The proximity matching is a game-changer. I’ve spent months looking for a suitable stud within a 50-mile radius with no luck. Having a dedicated 'dating app' for Doxies is exactly what the breeding community needs.”
— Mark D., Registered Breeder

'SITE GENERATION PROMPT: 

1. **Setup**: Create a new Project in the Stitch MCP titled "Dachshund Dating Service Landing Page".
2. **Generation**: Using the @stitch MCP and the new Project ID, generate a complete, high-fidelity landing page screen based on the structured content and design specifications in this file, following these instructions:
   a. **File Management**: Save all resulting files (index.html, CSS, boilerplate pages) into the `output` folder.
   b. **Design System**: Strictly adhere to the "DESIGN SYSTEM (REQUIRED)" section at the end of the file.
   c. **Content Integration**:
      - **Hero Section**: Use the selected Headline and Sub-headline.
      - **Problem Section**: Implement the PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solve) copy.
      - **Value Props**: Display the core features and benefit-driven headlines.
      - **Social Proof**: Include the generated testimonials.
      - **CTA**: Place the Call to Action and signup form as specified. Note: use the google form embed code for the form. **CRITICAL**: All Call to Action buttons must be implemented as anchor links (e.g., `#form-section`) that scroll the user down to the signup form section.
   d. **Technical Requirements**:
      - **Responsiveness**: The site MUST be fully responsive and look stunning on both Desktop and Mobile devices. Use a container-based layout that breathes on large screens but remains functional on small ones.
      - Use semantic HTML and modern CSS.
      - minimise dependencies on external libraries.
      - optimize for fast loading and accessibility.
      - the site should be static HTML/CSS/JS suitable for deployment as a static site to Firebase Hosting.
   e. Add boilerplate pages for about us, privacy policy and terms of service in the `output` folder and link to them from the landing page footer.
   f. If a Gemini chatbot is added do not make it require a login. It should be available to all visitors. It should not require microphone nor camera permissions.

Execute the site generation using the Stitch MCP, save the files to the `output` directory, and provide the preview link or file path.

- if the cli does not have node and npm installed and available, install it using the instructions here https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- if the cli does not have firebase-tools installed and available, install it using `npm install -g firebase-tools`.

1.  **Project Creation**:
