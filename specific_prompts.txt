   - Buy books online and never finish them.
   - Scroll on their phones instead of reading.
   Why it fails: No environment designed for focus. No community feeling. No curated reading experience.

HERO SECTION
================================================================================

Headline: Your Perfect Reading Escape — Where Every Sip Sparks a Story

Sub-headline: Little Leaf is a book-lover's cafe with mood-curated shelves and quiet reading zones — so you read more, stress less, and find your flow in one visit.

================================================================================

THE PROBLEM SECTION
================================================================================

Dear Book Lover,

- Are you tired of trying to read in a coffee shop — only to give up because it's too loud?
- Do you keep buying books you never finish because home is just as distracting?
- Do you wish there was somewhere quiet, comfortable, and actually designed for people like you?

You already know the feeling.

You sit down at your usual cafe. You open your book. Someone laughs too loud at the table next to you. A playlist you didn't choose starts playing. Your order takes forever. **Before you've read a single page, you've already given up.**

You try reading at home. But the dishes need doing. Your phone buzzes. Netflix is right there. **You mean to read. You just never actually do.**

It's not a willpower problem. **It's an environment problem.**

Every "third space" you have access to was built for someone else — not for the reader in you. Not for the version of you that wants to slow down, think clearly, and actually live a little.

The cost of staying stuck? Another year of unfinished books on your shelf. Another afternoon scrolling instead of savoring. Another version of yourself you meant to become — but didn't quite get there.

But here's the thing: you don't need more discipline.

**You need Little Leaf.**

We didn't build another coffee shop. We built the space that readers have always deserved — quiet reading zones, specialty drinks crafted for long stays, and a mood-curated library that matches the perfect book to how you're feeling right now. One visit and you'll understand why this is different. This is the place you come to become the person who reads.

SOCIAL PROOF

Testimonial 1:
"I've been dreaming of a place like this for years. Other cafes are chaos, home is full of distractions — there's genuinely nowhere to go if you just want to sit, read, and breathe. Little Leaf is the third space our city has been missing. I'm counting down the days until it opens."
— Sofia Reyes, Freelance Graphic Designer

Testimonial 2:
"As a student, I spend so much money hopping between coffee shops just trying to find one that's quiet enough to concentrate. The idea that Little Leaf pairs your drink to your reading mood? That's not just a cafe — that's an experience. I'm already telling my whole study group about this."
— Marcus Tan, University Student

Testimonial 3:
"I have a whole shelf of books I bought and never finished. Sound familiar? The problem was never motivation — it was environment. Finally, a place that understands that. I've been waiting for something like Little Leaf my entire adult life. Take my money. Take my weekends. Just open already."
