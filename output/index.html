        <h2 class="section-heading">Dear Book Lover,</h2>
        <ul class="pas-questions">
          <li>Are you tired of trying to read in a coffee shop — only to give up because it's too loud?</li>
          <li>Do you keep buying books you never finish because home is just as distracting?</li>
          <li>Do you wish there was somewhere quiet, comfortable, and actually designed for people like you?</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="pas-body">
          <p>You already know the feeling. You sit down at your usual cafe. You open your book. Someone laughs too loud
            at the table next to you. A playlist you didn't choose starts playing. <strong>Before you've read a single
              page, you've already given up.</strong></p>
          <p>You try reading at home. But the dishes need doing. Your phone buzzes. Netflix is right there. <strong>You
              mean to read. You just never actually do.</strong></p>
          <p>It's not a willpower problem. <strong>It's an environment problem.</strong></p>
          <p>Every "third space" you have access to was built for someone else — not for the reader in you. The cost of
            staying stuck? Another year of unfinished books on your shelf. Another afternoon scrolling instead of
            savoring.</p>
          <p>But here's the thing: you don't need more discipline.</p>
          <p class="pas-reveal"><strong>You need Little Leaf.</strong></p>
          <p>We didn't build another coffee shop. We built the space that readers have always deserved — quiet reading
            zones, specialty drinks crafted for long stays, and a mood-curated library that matches the perfect book to
            how you're feeling right now.</p>
